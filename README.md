# Faceplate-mod-rimworld
First ever mod I made because I'm always annoyed at how many of my pawns get their nose shot off or the occasional spear in the eye -_-  So loosely based around a few movies, games like Army of Two and Characters like Deathstroke. I've decided to make a tactical faceplate mod, which can be worn with hats :0  You just need 30 of any metallic resource and your machining bench.  Should also support mod added metallic resources  I hope you guys enjoy and remember this is literally my first attempt so go easy on me XD https://www.dropbox.com/s/nsgksjfcsmchcsc/Faceplate%201.0.rar?dl=0/  Future iterations may include leather versions for tribals and maybe a hockey mask type for brawlers  ASSISTANCE APPRECIATED Pawns jaws and eyes are currently covered, I spent about an hour trying to get noses as well but gave up so if anyone here would like to message me and/or help I will love you forever XD Modify message
